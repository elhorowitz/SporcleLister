Required Libraries: BeautifulSoup

This program takes games listed in the categories page of www.Sporcle.com and puts their titles into a text file. It also has the capability to tally all the words listed in the titles of the games, however, the commented code needs to be uncommented, and the csv file should be renamed "gamelist.csv".

To run: execute in the Python command line. 

The program was modeled from the code from my previous assignments on screenscraping. Therefore, some code was adapted from others in class.
